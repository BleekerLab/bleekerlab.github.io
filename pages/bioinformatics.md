# Tools 

## The "20 accessions" RNA-seq expression browser

[__Link to the tool__](https://bleekerlab.shinyapps.io/rnaseqvis/)  

This simple gene expression browser allows one to show the expression of one or several tomato genes based on stem trichome mRNA-seq. Based on a set of 20 tomato genotypes spanning 11 tomato species

The tomato ITAG2.0 genome assembly and the ITAG2.4 genome annotation were used. A custom pipeline (version 0.2.2) based on Kallisto and Sleuth available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BleekerLab/rnaseq-analysis-kallisto-sleuth/releases/tag/v0.2.2) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3627098). 
    
Original sequencing files can be found on Zenodo (restricted access):   
[part 1](https://zenodo.org/record/3603295), [part 2](https://zenodo.org/record/3610352), [part 3](https://zenodo.org/record/3610997), [part 4](https://zenodo.org/record/3611053), [part 5](https://zenodo.org/record/3611144).

# Datasets 

## Sequencing data

Sequencing data from the laboratory (mRNA-seq, small RNA-seq and DNA-seq) are available under restricted access on the [Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/communities/bleekerlab/).

## Wild tomato genomic references
Based on a Technology Hotel Funding scheme (Agrogenomcsics), the group has two draft genomes for _S. habrochaites_ LA1777 and _S. habrochaites_ PI127826. They are available on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3712239) provided you are granted access.


## Tomato trichome pictures
[Here](https://zenodo.org/record/3555363) you can find tomato stem trichome high-resolution pictures for the genotypes listed below:
