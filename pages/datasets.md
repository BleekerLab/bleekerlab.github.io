During the course of our research, several datasets related to wild tomato genomes and trichomes were generated. 
If interested, please navigate to the [Bleeker Lab community page on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/bleekerlab/?page=1&size=20) and request access to the relevant datasets. 

# Datasets 

## Sequencing data - "20 accessions" 

Sequencing data from the laboratory (mRNA-seq, small RNA-seq and DNA-seq) are available under restricted access on the [Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/communities/bleekerlab/).





## Wild tomato genomic references
Based on a Technology Hotel Funding scheme (Agrogenomcsics), the group has two draft genomes for _S. habrochaites_ LA1777 and _S. habrochaites_ PI127826. They are available on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3712239) provided you are granted access.


## Tomato trichome pictures
[Here](https://zenodo.org/record/3555363) you can find tomato stem trichome high-resolution pictures for the genotypes listed below:
