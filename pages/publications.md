Volatiles mediate the interaction of plants with pollinators, herbivores and 
their natural enemies, other plants and micro-organisms. With increasing 
knowledge about these interactions the underlying mechanisms turn out to be 
increasingly complex. The mechanisms of biosynthesis and perception of volatiles 
are slowly being uncovered. The increasing scientific knowledge can be used to 
design and apply volatile-based agricultural strategies.

Plants have developed diverse defence mechanisms to ward off herbivorous pests. 
However, agriculture still faces estimated crop yield losses ranging from 25% to 
40% annually. These losses arise not only because of direct feeding damage, but 
also because many pests serve as vectors of plant viruses. Herbivorous thrips 
(Thysanoptera) are important pests of vegetable and ornamental crops worldwide, 
and encompass virtually all general problems of pests: they are highly 
polyphagous, hard to control because of their complex lifestyle, and they are 
vectors of destructive viruses. Currently, control management of thrips mainly 
relies on the use of chemical pesticides. However, thrips rapidly develop 
resistance to these pesticides. With the rising demand for more sustainable, 
safer, and healthier food production systems, we urgently need to pinpoint the 
gaps in knowledge of plant defences against thrips to enable the future 
development of novel control methods. In this review, we summarize the current, 
rather scarce, knowledge of thrips-induced plant responses and the role of 
phytohormonal signalling and chemical defences in these responses. We describe 
concrete opportunities for breeding resistance against pests such as thrips as a 
prototype approach for next-generation resistance breeding.
